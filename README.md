My project is to create visualizations to help readers learn the celestial movement based on
Newton's law of universal gravitation. I will use the interactive visualization model of “a satellite
orbit around a planet” to help readers understand and explore the subject. Interactive visualizations are based on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
